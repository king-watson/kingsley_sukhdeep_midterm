      <h1>Cons of Scoial Media </h1>
      <p><h3>The negative effects of social media include mental health problems like anxiety and despair, a decline in face-to-face engagement that impairs social skills, and serious privacy issues including cyberbullying and data security threats. The abundance of information available to users frequently causes cognitive overload, which impairs their ability to make decisions. Additionally, the presentation of unattainable standards might distort their perception of themselves and encourage feelings of inadequacy. In conclusion, social media may improve connectedness, but its drawbacks also emphasize how important it is to use it carefully and balance it with in-person relationships.</h3></p>

<h1>Pros of Social Media - Kingsley</h1>
  
<p> To begin with, I think social media is a fantastic tool for a lot of adults and teens. In the first place, it makes it possible for those who live far apart or 
struggle to find time to hang out to stay in touch. When used responsibly, social media can help us make lifelong memories and online friendships. 
Second, most marketing is currently done online. Companies use social media postings or advertisements to connect with their target audience. 
Since social media is widely used, reaching a wider audience is less costly.  Lastly, it gives us a source of enjoyment that might improve our attitude for the day. 
During our free time, we can engage in social interactions and enjoy a dopamine rush while browsing through our phones. 
In conclusion, I believe social media is excellent for adults and teens, and it can be especially helpful for children when used appropriately. 
Social media thrives and is beneficial for us because of things like friendships, marketing and business, the entertainment value, and many more. </p>
